/**
 * this file should represent ur configurations & ports.<p>
 * there are some examples here, ur welcome to change it however u want.</p>
 * please remember that cuttlefish is an experimental library,
 * if u dont get along with it, please go back to normal strings configuration.
 * <p>
 * notice that there are some things that i still haven't figured out how to use on cuttle fish,
 * for example: i still couldn't figure out how to use CR Servos.
 * in this case, i've used the normal string configuration to control it.
 * if u have more things that are missing, u can still combine the 2 methods.
 * im still not sure whether it just doesn't exist, or i don't know how to use it, so feel free to look around their docs and src.
